Passing Marks
Time Limit: 2, Memory Limit: 256000
In a class of N students, a class test was held. The ith student scored Aiâ€‹ marks. It is also known that the scores of all students were distinct. A student passes the test if their score is strictly greater than the passing mark. Given that exactly X students pass in the test, find the maximum value of the passing mark of the test.

Input
The first line contains 2 space separated integers N and X denoting the number of students in the class and the number of students that passed in the test.
The following line contains N space separated integers A1,  A2,......., An denoting the marks of the ith student.
Output
Return the maximum value of the passing mark of the test.
Example
Sample Input
2 2
5 1
Sample Output
0
Explanation
Since both students pass the test, both students scored greater than passing marks. The maximum value of passing marks can be 0, as both students have marks greater than 0.
