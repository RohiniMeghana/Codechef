Time Limit: 2, Memory Limit: 256000
In a City, there are X schools, and each school has Y students.In the end of a year total of Z students passed the exams. Assuming that all students appeared for the exams, find whether the number of students who passed in City was strictly greater than 50%.

Input
The only line of input contains three space separated integers X, Y and Z denoting the number of schools, number of students and number of students passed the exams respectively.

Constraints
1 ≤ X ≤ 5
1 ≤ Y ≤ 50
0 ≤ Z ≤ X*Y
Output
Return "Yes" if the total number of students who passed in a city was strictly greater than 50%, otherwise return "No".
Example
Sample Input:
2 10 12
Sample Output:
Yes
Explanation
The total number of students appeared were 2*10=20. The number of students passed were
12. Thus, number of students who passed are 60%, which is strictly greater than 50%.
