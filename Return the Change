In Zomaland, denominations less than rupees 10 have stopped and now rupees 10 is the smallest denomination.
Suppose Zoma goes to buy some item with cost not a multiple of 10, then, he will be charged the cost that is the nearest multiple of 10.
If the cost is equally distant from two nearest multiples of 10, then the cost is rounded up.
For example, 35, 38, 40, 44 are all rounded to 40.
Zoma purchased an item having cost X (X ≤ 100) and gave a bill of rupees 100. How much amount will he get back?

Input
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer X, the cost of the item.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ X ≤ 100
Output
For each test case, output the amount returned to Zoma.
Example
Input
2
35
54
Output
60
50
Explanation
Test case 1: The cost of the item is rounded up to 40. Thus, Zoma gets back 100 − 40 = 60 rupees.
Test case 2:  The cost of the item is rounded down to 50. Thus, Zoma gets back 100 − 50 = 50 rupees.
