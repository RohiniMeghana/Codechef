Chess Champions
Time Limit: 2, Memory Limit: 256000
Nachev and Carlsen are playing in the championship having 14 games between them, where each game has one of three outcomes — it can be won by Carlsen, won by Nachev, or it can be a draw. The winner of a game gets 2 points, and the loser gets 0 points. If it’s a draw, both players get 1 point each.
The total prize pool of the championship is 100⋅X. At end of the 14 Classical games, if one player has strictly more points than the other, he is declared the champion and gets 60⋅X as his prize money, and the loser gets 40⋅X. If the total points are tied, then the defending champion Carlsen is declared the winner. However, if this happens, the winner gets only 55⋅X, and the loser gets 45⋅X.
