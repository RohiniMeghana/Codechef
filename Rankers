Rankers
Time Limit: 2, Memory Limit: 256000
Two friends, Ram and Shyam, are writing a computer science examination series. There are three subjects in this series: DSA, TOC, and DM. Each subject carries 100 marks.You know the individual scores of both Ram and Shyam in all 3 subjects. You have to determine who got a better rank.

The rank is decided as follows:
->The person with a bigger total score gets a better rank
->If the total scores are tied, the person who scored higher in DSA gets a better rank
->If the total score and the DSA score are tied, the person who scored higher in TOC gets a better rank
->If everything is tied, they get the same rank.

Input
The first line contains three space-separated integers denoting the scores of Ram in DSA, TOC and DM respectively.
The second line contains three space-separated integers denoting the scores of Shyam in DSA,  TOC and DM respectively.

Constraints:
Each score of both Ram and Shyam lies between 0 and 100.
Output
Return "Ram" if Ram got a better rank else return "Shyam" if Shyam got a better rank . If there was a tie then output "Tie".
Example
Sample Input:
10 20 30
30 20 10
Sample Output:
Shyam
Explanation
For the first test case, Ram and Shyam have the same total score but Shyam gets a better rank because he has a higher score in DSA.
