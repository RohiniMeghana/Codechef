Ram and Shyam play the following game. Ram eats 1 candy, then Shyam eats 2 candies, then Ram eats 3 candies, then Shyam eats 4 candies, and so on. Once someone can't eat what he is supposed to eat, he loses.Ram can eat at most A candies in total while Shyam can eat at most B candies in total. Who will win the game? Print "Ram" or "Shyam" accordingly.

Input
The only line of input contains two integers A and B denoting the maximum possible number of candies Ram can eat and the maximum possible number of candies Shyam can eat respectively.

Constraints:
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 1000
Output
Return "Ram" if Ram wins otherwise print "Shyam".
Example
Sample Input:
3 2
Sample Output:
Shyam
Explanation
We have A = 3 and B = 2. Ram eats 1 candy first, and then Shyam eats 2 candies. Then Ram is supposed to eat 3 candies but that would mean 1 + 3 = 4 candies in total. It's impossible because he can eat at most A candies, so he loses. Shyam wins, and so we print "Shyam".
