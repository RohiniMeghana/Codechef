Paper Cutting
Time Limit: 2, Memory Limit: 256000
Neha has a square-shaped chart paper with the side length equal to N. She wants to cut out K x K squares from this chart paper. Find the maximum number of K x K squares she can cut from the entire chart paper.
Note that, some part of the chart paper might not be a included in any K x K cutout square.

Input
The first line contains a single integer T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K - the side length of the entire chart paper and the side length of the cutout squares.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 1000
Output
For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of K x K squares Neha can cut from the entire chart paper.
Example
Sample Input
2
5 1
2 2
Sample Output
25
1
Explanation
Test case 1: Neha can cut out 25 squares of size 1 x 1 from the entire 5 x 5 chart paper.
Test case 2: Neha can cut out 1 square of size 2 x 2 from the entire 2 x 2 chart paper.
