Ageing
Time Limit: 2, Memory Limit: 256000
Naina's current age is 20 years, while Yash's current age is 10 years.
Determine Yash's age when Naina will be X years old.
Note: Assume that Naina and Yash were born on same day and same month (just different year).

Input
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer X, the age of Naina.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 25
25 ≤ X ≤ 50
Output
For each test case, output Yash's age when Naina will be X years old.
Example
Sample Input
2
25
36
Sample Output
15
26
Explanation
Test case 1: Yash is 10 years old when Naina is 20 years old. Thus, when Naina would be 25, Yash would be 15.
Test case 2: Yash is 10 years old when Naina is 20 years old. Thus, when Naina would be 36, Yash would be 26.
